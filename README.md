# 🌍 Quiz App
The Quiz App is an Android application developed as part of the The Complete Android 12 & Kotlin Development Masterclass on Udemy. Being a slightly more experienced developer, instead of skipping this project, I decided to use it to experiment with Jetpack Compose and clean architecture. This project serves as a fun and interactive way for users to engage with a quiz-like experience, while showcasing the power and flexibility of Jetpack Compose and Android's modern development tools.
